## How Images Display

The website automatically applies a professional gradient background to all images:
- **Background:** Cream to white gradient (`#faf8f5` → `#ffffff` → `#faf8f5`)
- **Display:** Images use `object-contain` to show full person
- **Styling:** Professional rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects

## Next Steps

1. ✅ dress1.png is ready - already processed
2. Process dress2.png using:
   - [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg) (recommended)
   - Or any background removal tool
3. Replace `public/dress2.png` with processed version
4. Run `npm run dev` to see the results!

**Note:** The professional gradient background is applied via CSS, so even if your processed images have black backgrounds, they'll display beautifully on the website.
