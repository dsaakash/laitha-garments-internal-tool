we work on both kind of clothing customized and as well catalogue based product

Lalitha Garments offers both **customized/bespoke clothing** (made-to-order) and **catalogue-based products** (ready-made collections). Let me update the landing page and add comprehensive information to reflect both business models, so customers understand all their options.


1. **"What We Offer"** section now displays two distinct service cards - Customized Clothing and Catalogue Collections - so customers immediately understand they can either get bespoke designs or browse ready-made options.
2. **Hero section** tagline updated to mention both services, and the catalogue button encourages customers to explore your collection.
3. **Process section** is now labeled "Custom Order Process" to clarify it's specifically for custom orders, not catalogue purchases.
